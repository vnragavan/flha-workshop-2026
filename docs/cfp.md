# Call for Papers

## Scope
FLHA focuses on federated learning methods, systems, and real-world deployments for healthcare applications. We welcome submissions spanning algorithms, privacy and security, clinical constraints, and operational experiences.

## Topics of Interest
Topics include, but are not limited to:
- Federated survival models
- Federated optimization and personalization for healthcare
- Cross-silo and cross-device FL (institutions, consortia, wearables, patient devices)
- Privacy and security for healthcare FL (secure aggregation, differential privacy, blockchains, and trusted execution environments; attacks and defenses (e.g., poisoning, backdoor, inference); robustness, monitoring, safe training)
- Fairness and bias mitigation with clinical relevance
- Handling heterogeneity: non-IID data, label shift, missingness, multi-modal data
- Federated learning for imaging, EHR, genomics, and remote monitoring
- System design: communication efficiency, scheduling, client selection, edge deployments
- Evaluation methodology, benchmarks, and reproducible pipelines
- Governance, auditing, regulatory and ethical considerations
- Lessons learned from deployments in hospitals and clinical workflows

## Submission Tracks and Expected Length
Submission categories will be determined during the review process. Based on reviewers’ evaluations, each submission may be accepted as a full paper, short/position paper, or poster.
- **Full papers**: mature contributions with thorough evaluation  
  Recommended length: **8–9 pages** (excluding references)
- **Short or position papers**: early ideas, focused contributions, lessons learned  
  Recommended length: **4–6 pages** (excluding references)
- **Posters**: work in progress, preliminary results, demos, datasets, systems  
  Recommended length: **1–2 pages** (excluding references)

## Review Criteria
Submissions will be evaluated on:
- Relevance to federated learning in healthcare
- Originality and technical quality
- Clarity of problem statement and contribution
- Soundness of evaluation or strength of motivation (for position and posters)
- Responsible handling of healthcare constraints (privacy, bias, governance)

## Ethics and Responsible Research
For work involving human data, authors should describe the data governance context and privacy safeguards. If applicable, briefly state approval or exemption status and de-identification procedures.

## Presentation
All accepted contributions will be presented at the workshop:
- Full and short papers: oral talk or lightning talk (to be assigned)
- Posters: poster session presentation
