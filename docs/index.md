# Federated Learning in Healthcare Applications (FLHA)

FLHA is a one-day workshop co-located with FLICS 2026 in Valencia, Spain (9–12 June 2026). The exact workshop day will be announced with the FLICS workshop schedule.

## Overview
Healthcare data is distributed across institutions and governed by strict privacy and compliance constraints. Federated learning enables collaborative model development without centralizing sensitive data. FLHA brings together researchers and practitioners to discuss methods, systems, and deployments of federated learning in healthcare settings.

## Submission Tracks
We invite:
- Full papers
- Short or position papers
- Posters

## Important Dates
All deadlines are Anywhere on Earth (AoE) unless stated otherwise.
- Workshop paper submission: **May 10, 2026**
- Paper notification: **May 20, 2026**
- Camera-ready submission: **TBD**

## Topics
Examples include:
- Cross-silo federated learning across hospitals and health systems
- Federated learning for medical imaging, EHR, genomics, and wearables
- Privacy and security: secure aggregation, differential privacy, trusted execution, auditing
- Robustness: poisoning, backdoors, failure modes, Byzantine resilience
- Personalization, heterogeneity, non-IID data, domain shift
- Fairness, bias, subgroup performance, clinical safety considerations
